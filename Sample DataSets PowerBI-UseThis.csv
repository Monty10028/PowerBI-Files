Fainted due to low blood pressure and hit head. ","Monique (preferred name Elizabeth) was driving to work this morning and was involved in a near miss car accident. Her vehicle was not impacted and she did not impact another vehicle however the incident did leave her shaken up at the time. By the time she arrived at work she was in good spirits and did not mention any pains. Post lunch, she attended the bathroom and when came back to her desk to sit down collapsed. 
No staff member witnessed the fall however heard the bang of her (presumed) head on the desk. 
Staff advised that upon investigation she appeared to be convulsing and had an altered state of consciousness. At this stage I was looking for a first aid officer, arranging for an ambulance to be called and getting the first aid kit. 
Upon investigation Elizabeth did not have any open wounds or evident bruising and she was placed into the fetal position while an ambulance was called and they advised to keep her still and to not give her food or drink. 
Elizabeth's sister (Cass) also works in the CPU and sat with her while waiting for the ambulance. 
Between calling for the ambulance and when the paramedics arrived Elizabeth seemed to recover slightly however was disorientated as to what had occurred.
The ambulance took approx 45 minutes to arrive from calling and Elizabeth was kept still and talking throughout the waiting period. 
The paramedics assessed Elizabeth and determined she had low blood pressure and they then requested that she should go to the hospital if she wishes however Elizabeth did not want too. 
As an alternate process, the paramedics and Elizabeth spoke to a virtual ED Doctor who completed an independent assessment and determined that this was a fainting episode linked to the low blood pressure. 
Elizabeth was cleared to drive home in a couple of hours however I spoke with her family who asked for her to stay with her sister (Cass) as it is closer to the office and I sent both girls home to recover. Cass drove Elizabeth to Cass' house. 
I have requested Elizabeth take tomorrow off and I will check in with her tomorrow.

","Was removing battery component from back off of LED Batten-Style light. The battery component was held on using foam adhesive, which required a knife to remove.

During the removal was cutting the adhesive with my left hand in a motion towards myself with my right hand grabbing the end of the bench for support and extra strength.

Once the end of the adhesive strip was cut I followed through with the knife due to the amount of force being applied and as a natural reaction I attempted to remove right hand from bench right away however the knife made contact to my joint between my top and middle of my right index finger.

The first reaction to this was to apply pressure with my other hand and prevent blood being spilled around the area.

The second step was to go to the bathroom and clean the wound under clean water and use the tissues as a temporary bandage

The third phase was to alert my workmate of the incident to prevent any confusion regarding any blood found on the floors or benches

The forth step then was to alert the safety officer and first aider on site for assistance

The final solution was to alert IMS of the incident and a medical professional came on site and had a look, and bandaged the cut using sterile strips and other items and instructed myself on how to ensure the cut does not get infected and heals

As of the 27/5/2020 a incident report has been completed on the hosts end and the cut itself is showing early signs of recovery .

Subject: Re. CTA participant William Fraser falling 
 
Hi Anhie,
 
At approx. 11:45 this morning, CTA participant William Fraser fell as he was negotiating the step leading to the kitchen. He fell onto the floor, but stood up independently and stated that he was okay. He then subsequently used the toilet. 
 
When William finished using the toilet, I advised him that I was the First Aid Officer on-site. William again stated that he was okay. He was advised to talk with myself or Maria (CTA Convenor) if he felt unwell. 
 
CTA Convenor Maria advised of the above incident and action.
 
‘Please Watch The Step’ sign stuck up on the wall next to the step at 11:50.
 
thanks

For Dale Todd, Channel SMB test account/ 15 Noble Way Sunbury 3429 0490 782 231
this Job was a battery replacement for a Dell Latitude E5570, as it was out of warranty dell support informed me it was paid on the 9th of August 2022, upon calling the customer he had informed me because on the nature of his work he would be out on a construction site I was given the address of 533-555 High Street Melton (Woodgrove shopping center) as work had been quite slow that day and it wasn't much further I agreed.  I arrived Approximately 12:15pm on Friday 12th of August. Woodgrove is constructing an outdoor dining area so there was a portable office in the car-park, this was my worksite for this job. I met Dale at the foodcourt and he showed me past the trucks digging up the car park to the office, I sat at his desk and started working on the system I asked a few basic questions about the system like how long he had it (3months) was a previous workers system and asked him about the works they were doing ( the outdoor dining area). He asked me &quot;so are you married with kids or?&quot;  (I didn't click and was just responding to everything because I am a moron trying not to be rude) so I said &quot;nah, you?&quot; ( I didn't actually listen to to his response I dont really give a !@#) I went quiet doing my job.   then he asked me what I was doing on the weekend and I said I would be catching up cleaning my house and I asked if he had any big plans, He said something about his dog  so I ask him about his dog its like a half wolf breed that I had never heard of. he asked if I go around to peoples houses to fix computers I say yes,he says  &quot;do you see anything weird going to peoples houses?&quot;, &quot;I say nothing out of the ordinary&quot;. He then goes on to tell me about his time as a landscaper and how women would request &quot;him&quot; after hours and how much &quot;fun&quot; he had with female contractors working at construction sites and all the colleagues who use drugs. at first I thought he was bitching about this situations so I kinda responded with an exaggerated wowww. at this point I am shaking, so every time he speaks I ask him a stupid unnecessary question about his computer like if hes every had any other problems with it and how he finds using it. he then compliments the blue of my eyes. I was here for no more than 25min its a battery job, shut down back cover off plug in cover on F12 I didn't run full diags I snapped a photo and left he didn't say anything more to me. I was starting to freak out I actually got lost in the shopping centre I spent a while just crying thinking about how if things had have escalated no one knew where I was, no one could have helped me and there is no way of me knowing what kind of environment I will be working in, I want  Dale to know that what he said was inappropriate, I want the company to acknowledge their responsibly for providing a safe working environment for their female contractors. I want Unisys, Dell, Lenovo and Apple to take more care in ensuring customers understand that they provide a working environment for us. How can we make sure this never happens again, how can we identify a potentially hostile environment, I don't think I am equipped with the knowledge to deal with these situations And would like more support around risk management strategies this could include questionnaires for customers, other safety plans if an Engineer is in an unsafe environment, who can they call, code words, using click if an engineer isn't responding or stays in the same place for a while what can we do to help them. I want to know I can be safe and do this job I have really fallen in love with the work I do, the places I get to see the amazing people I meet, I don't want to give that up but I am scared for the bad experiences ",A,VIC,Hospital,Not set,0,MTI,Not set,Not set,17-02-23,13-05-23,2:00am,16-05-23,14-11-00,Oil,LG,Male,Vehicle Incident,Hit stationary object,While working at the usual workplace
